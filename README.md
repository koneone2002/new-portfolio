# new-portfolio

This is my new portfolio
##
I used bootstrap to set up the layout and design
I used JavaScript for the button actions
Firebase is used to retrieve form input
Portfolio images are clickable and will go to the actual applications
###
Still to do:
Update photo and about me information - photo is not current - content is not exciting

Mobile Responsiveness is still off needs to be adjusted

More exciting portfolio pieces need to be added
