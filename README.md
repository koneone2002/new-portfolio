# new-portfolio

This is my new portfolio
##
I used bootstrap to set up the layout and design
I used JavaScript for the button actions
Firebase is used to retrieve form input
Portfolio buttons are clickable and will go to the actual applications and code
###
Still to do:
Update photo and about me information - photo is not current - content is not exciting


More exciting portfolio pieces need to be added
